## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public GitHub Issue for security reports.

Use one of the following:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred): `Security` tab → `Report a vulnerability`
2. (Optional) Email a private contact address if you operate one (replace this line with a real address)

Include:

- Affected component (Web/API)
- Steps to reproduce / PoC (if available)
- Impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

We will acknowledge receipt and work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline.
