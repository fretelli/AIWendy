## 🔧 Customization

### Add More Exchanges

Edit `lib/api/user-exchanges.ts`:

```typescript
export type ExchangeType = 'okx' | 'bybit' | 'coinbase' | 'kraken' | 'ibkr' | 'kucoin'
```

Add to backend `domain/exchange/models.py`:

```python
class ExchangeType(str, enum.Enum):
    OKX = "okx"
    BYBIT = "bybit"
    COINBASE = "coinbase"
    KRAKEN = "kraken"
    IBKR = "ibkr"
    KUCOIN = "kucoin"  # New
```

### Change Exchange Icons

Edit `app/(dashboard)/settings/exchanges/page.tsx`:

```typescript
const getExchangeIcon = (exchangeType: string) => {
  const icons: Record<string, string> = {
    okx: "⚫",
    bybit: "🟠",
    coinbase: "🔵",
    kraken: "🟣",
    ibkr: "🏦",
    kucoin: "🟢",  // Add new icon
  }
  return icons[exchangeType] || "🔷"
}
```

### Customize Card Layout

The exchange cards use shadcn/ui `Card` component with Tailwind CSS. Modify the grid:

```tsx
<div className="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
  {/* Change md:grid-cols-2 to adjust tablet layout */}
  {/* Change lg:grid-cols-3 to adjust desktop layout */}
</div>
```

## 📝 Code Quality

The code follows:
- ✅ TypeScript best practices
- ✅ React hooks patterns
- ✅ shadcn/ui component library
- ✅ Tailwind CSS utility classes
- ✅ Error handling with try/catch
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Accessibility (keyboard navigation)
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Real-Time Sync:** Manual test button required
2. **Single Exchange Type:** Can't add multiple connections of different types in one form
3. **No Bulk Operations:** Can't test/delete multiple at once
4. **No Connection History:** Doesn't track connection changes over time

These can be addressed in future updates.
